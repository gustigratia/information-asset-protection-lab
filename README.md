# Information Asset Protection â€” Practical Scripts

**Description**  
This repository contains a small set of scripts used during the *Information Asset Protection* laboratory sessions.  
It serves as a reference collection of runnable examples and short utilities created throughout the course.  
The structure is intentionally simple, focusing on clarity rather than organization.

---

## Contents
The repository may include:
- Python scripts used for demonstrations.  
- Simple configuration or helper files.

There is no strict folder structure; scripts are stored directly in the root directory for convenience.
